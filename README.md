## About The Project

![Work Day Scheduler Screen Shot](./assets/imgs/Work-Day-Scheduler.png)

This javascript scheduler was built as a coding assessment, trying to achieve both functionality and great looks! 

Made following these premises:
* GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
* WHEN I open the planner
* THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
* WHEN I scroll down
* THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
* WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
* THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
* WHEN I click into a timeblock
* THEN I can enter an event
* WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
* THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
* WHEN I refresh the page
* THEN the saved events persist

The app runs in the browser and features HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery and Moment.js.
